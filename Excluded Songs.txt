131 - Queen Rhythm Song / all rhythm songs are excluded as they don't have one to one versions present in the game files
51 - Cyber Battle / it's a mix of the entire cyber battle against the music guys in chapter 2. It isn't present in the game files in a complete form
87 - Berdly Rejected Concept / it's a rejected concept for berdly and is therefore not present in the game files
106 107 - rhythm game chapter 3 / as explained previously for 131
148 - Ripple / combined song for the boss in chapter 3. It isn't used in a complete form in the game and is therefore excluded
109 - Glowing Snow / slowed down version of tv_results_screen, speeding it up introduces distortion so it's not viable to convert it
94 100 - Retro Songs / I think they might be somewhere in the files but after checking multiple times, I'm really not sure. If someone finds them let me know and I'll update the csv
164 - AIRWAVES / Nintendo switch exclusive song apparently
165 - Concert for you / Made up song by toby as a nod to kris playing the piano in chapter 4
